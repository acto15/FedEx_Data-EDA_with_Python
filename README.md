# FedEx EDA with Python



## Project Overview
A data-driven exploration of FedEx shipment records using Python to uncover operational patterns, vendor performance, and regional shipment insights.


## Project Description
This project performs a deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on FedEx delivery history data.  
Using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly, the project cleans, transforms, and visualizes real-world logistics data.  
The analysis includes handling missing values, analyzing shipment modes, studying vendor trends, and understanding country-level shipment dynamics.  
The project delivers actionable insights through 13 detailed visualizations and strong data storytelling.


## Business Impact
- Identified that 22% of shipment records had missing fields, helping prioritize critical data cleaning efforts.
- Highlighted that the top 5 countries accounted for 67% of total shipment value, focusing business strategy on key regions.
- Revealed that 75% of shipments relied on just two shipment modes, enabling logistics cost optimization and risk management.


## Key Findings
- Shipment activity showed clear seasonal peaks, with highest volumes recorded in Q2 across years.
- Top 5 vendors contributed nearly 70% of the total shipment value, suggesting strong vendor concentration risk.
- Significant missing values were found in delivery tracking and purchase order fields, requiring urgent data pipeline improvements.
